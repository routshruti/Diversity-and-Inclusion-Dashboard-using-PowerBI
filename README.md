## Insights
Demographics:
- The organization has a total of 500 employees, with 295 being male and 205 female.
- Full-time employees are 465, out of which 293 are males and 172 are females.
- Part-time employees are 35, out of which 2 are males and 33 are females.
- The majority of employees are from Switzerland and other European countries.
- Across different age groups, there are consistently more male employees than female employees.
- At lower levels, the female employee representation is higher, indicating greater gender diversity in entry level roles. However, as the hierarchy progresses to senior levels (e.g., manager, director, executive), there is a marked increase in male representation, suggesting a gender imbalance at the top of the organization.

Hiring:

- In the most recent hiring period, a total of 66 employees were hired. Of these, 32 were male (48%) and 34 were female (52%). Full-time positions accounted for 58 hires, while 8 hires were part-time. 
- Departmental Hiring Breakdown:
  - **Operations**: 59% female, 41% male
  - **Sales and Marketing**: 61% male, 39% female
  - **Internal Services**: 45% male, 55% female
  - **Stratergy**: 60% male, 40% female
  - **Finance**: 50% male, 50% female
  - **HR**: 100% of hires were female
- At the **executive level**, only male employees were hired.
- The **average years of work experience** for the hired employees is 3.86, with more males having higher levels of experience than females.
- In the **50-69 age group**, only men were hired, while in the **20-49 age group**, both men and women were hired.
- The data shows a consistent improvement in hiring more women since 2017, with 2020 marking the highest percentage of female hires at 52%. However, the lack of female representation in executive-level hires remains the main area of concern for gender diversity.

Performance Ratings and Promotion: 

- On average, men have slightly higher performance ratings than women, but the difference is marginal. This suggests that performance is not a major factor in promotion decisions, but there may be implicit biases impacting evaluations.
- In FY21, the promotion rate for males and females increased to 11% and 9%, respectively, from 9% and 4%. Unlike FY20, where no females were promoted to executive or director-level roles, FY21 saw one female promoted to this level. Additionally, more females than males were promoted to senior officer roles.
- This shift in promotions between FY20 and FY21 reflects positive progress toward gender balance. However, the overall promotion rates and continued underrepresentation of females at the executive level highlight the need for further efforts to ensure equitable advancement opportunities for women.

Turnover:

- The turnover rate for men is higher than for women.
- This suggests that gender imbalance may be due to other factors rather than female employees leaving the company.
- Analyzing exit interviews for male employees could provide insights into whether workplace culture, career development opportunities, or other factors are contributing to this trend.

## Conclusion

HR team should focus on:
- Encouraging early career development for women with mentorship programs that guide them toward executive roles.
- Enhancing workplace flexibility through hybrid models and flexible working hours, particularly for those women balancing career and family responsibilities.
- Regularly measuring progress through diversity metrics and adjust recruitment, promotion, and retention strategies based on data insights.
- Conducting regular feedback sessions and employee engagement surveys to understand what women need in terms of inclusivity, flexibility, and advancement. Tailor retention strategies based on this data.
- Addressing potential unconscious biases in performance evaluations by conducting bias training and implementing more structured performance assessments.
